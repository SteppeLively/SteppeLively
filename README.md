# About Me
ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on data integrations for work. Our data is in too many places for me to keep track of, yo.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, APIs, python, and I'm sure a half-dozen other things.

ğŸ“« How to reach me: I like new friends! Feel free to email me at **steppelively@gmail.com**

ğŸ˜„ **Pronouns:** she/her (yeah, I know I listed that elsewhere, but I get misgendered frequently, so I figure repetition can't be a bad thing)
